This is React's [tutorial app](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#what-are-we-building) except as soon as I grabbed [their starter code which renders a static game board](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#setup-option-2-local-development-environment), I thought I should be able to and started building the app myself without referring to the rest of the tutorial.

I started self learning programming on [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freeCodeCamp.org) since mid Novermber 2020 and finished building this project on 19 April 2021 (when this readme was last updated), which I was really happy about because it showed I had truly learned and come a long way.

I intend to re-build the app following [React's full tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) to further learn about where I could have done better.
